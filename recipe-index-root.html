This broccoli salad recipe is easy to make, and even better, make ahead. A few hours or a day in the fridge gives the broccoli a chance to soften and soak up the dressing’s punchy flavor.

If you love oven roasted chickpeas, get ready: these air fryer chickpeas are even better. I’ve been making them on repeat lately. Here’s why: They’re ready in 15 minutes.&nbsp;Roasting chickpeas in the air fryer is about twice as fast as making roasted chickpeas in the oven. Bonus: the air fryer preheats in no time! They’re INSANELY crunchy.&nbsp;Expect to eat a few (erm…half) straight from the air fryer basket. They’re irresistible! I love sprinkling these crispy chickpeas over salads and grain bowls.

This rhubarb crisp recipe is my favorite spring dessert. I love it because it’s&nbsp;so easy (HUGE bonus points for not requiring pie crust), but it’s still completely delicious. A layer of fresh rhubarb bakes to jammy, sweet-tart perfection, and a brown sugar and oat crumble crisps up beautifully on top. I’m personally incapable of eating it without a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but hey, you do you. I’ve been making this rhubarb crisp recipe for years now. In fact, I first planned to share it three years ago, right around the time our son…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This air fryer asparagus recipe is one of the quickest, easiest spring side dishes. It calls for 5 basic ingredients, and it’s ready in under 10 minutes. I love that even though it’s that simple (5 ingredients! 10 minutes!), it’s still a fantastic way to showcase one of the best vegetables of the season. Who says recipes have to be complicated in order to be delicious? When it comes out of the air fryer, the asparagus is tender and juicy, with perfectly crispy tips.&nbsp;I can never resist sneaking a few spears straight out of the air fryer basket, the frizzled…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>What’s not to love about breakfast potatoes?

Use it to make enchiladas or chilaquiles, or simply scoop it up with tortilla chips! What is ranchero sauce? Ranchero sauce is a spicy tomato-based sauce that originated in Northern Mexico. It shares ingredients like tomatoes, chiles, and garlic with enchilada sauce and salsa roja, but some of its distinguishing features are that It contains fresh hot chiles like jalapeños.

We love it for two reasons. First, because it’s so simple—if you have tequila, lime juice, and orange liqueur on hand, you can make it in under 5 minutes! Second, because it’s so delicious. The lime juice gives it a tart, refreshing kick, which the sweet orange liqueur (and a touch of agave) balance nicely. On a warm spring or summer evening, there’s nothing I’d rather drink. If you’re new to making cocktails, this recipe is a great place to start.
