We sure did.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>If they met on Tumblr, maybe they like the same TV shows or video games or just like the same artists.</p><p>If they met on Facebook … they’re probably super old.</p><p>And if they met on Instagram … then at least one of them is super hot.</p><p>Anfisa&nbsp;Arkhipchenko, for all of her flaws, is definitely super hot.</p><p>And as fans of&nbsp;90 Day Fiance&nbsp;and even some of its stars have pointed it, it seems that&nbsp;Anfisa’s&nbsp;hotness was basically the&nbsp;dealmaker&nbsp;for this international couple.</p><p>As for Jorge … he had money.</p><p>Emphasis on had.</p><p>Anfisa wasn’t even a little shy about finding Jorge’s money appealing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>And when Jorge Nava’s finances turned out to not be quite as great as he’d let on, well … that’s when this couple’s relationship turned decidedly sour.</p><p>Jorge, it turned out, was tens of thousands of dollars in debt.</p><p>As far as Anfisa was concerned, Jorge had made promises to her — to buy her nice things and take care of her — and was then failing to live up to those promises.</p><p>Though she still enjoyed spending his money.</p><p>Disturbingly, 90 Day Fiance&nbsp;cameras caught <a href=#>Anfisa Arkhipchenko striking Jorge</a> in a fit of fury when he questioned whether she was handling a money discussion maturely.</p><p>(Don’t get us wrong, because Jorge was being a major tool, but domestic violence is never okay, no matter who is doing it)</p><p>That upsetting incident was not, however, what caused Jorge and Anfisa to split.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Instead, they apparently parted ways after Anfisa&nbsp;got into an argument with Jorge’s sister. We’re guessing that it was a "final straw" situation.</p><p>On the Tell All, the two of them seemed very done with each other.</p><p>Except … it now&nbsp;appears that they’re back together.</p><p>Like we said, the Tell All was filmed ahead of time. A lot can change in a few weeks.</p><p>Anfisa took to Instagram to announce that both she and Jorge Nava have signed with&nbsp;DWE Talent Management.</p><p>That’s the talent agency that represents a number of reality TV personalities, including the infamous Scott Disick.</p><p>if this had just been a case of Anfisa signing with "an agency," we’d assume that she’d be taking up modeling again.</p><p>After all, Anfisa was a model.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>She said during the Tell All (when confronted by Loren Brovarnik) that she had only avoided modeling here in the US because Jorge had promised to take care of her and assured her that she wouldn’t need to work.</p><p>But since the two of them signed together, we suspect that we’ll be seeing a lot more of them.</p><p>It’s not hard to see why an agency would want them.</p><p>The couple is wildly controversial among 90 Day Fiance fans.</p><p><a href=#>Anfisa Arkhipchenko&nbsp;may dislike her haters</a>, but being hated (up to a point) can be a recipe for success in this business.</p><p>For Anfisa, this is an opportunity to be closer to that which she loves most — the thing that made her come to America in the first place:</p><p>Money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>For Jorge, this sounds like an opportunity to get out of debt (if he hasn’t already, with that 90 Day Fiance money).</p><p>And maybe to further rekindle his relationship with Anfisa.</p><p>If that’s really what he wants.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WGcIWPZpuasV2btqK6wp5krKyRp3qiusWiqpplkae4qbXPnJ%2BeppukerS1xqecnWWkpHqiuoyanp6mk656o63CpGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./savannah-buffett-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Savannah Buffett Net Worth</span></a>
