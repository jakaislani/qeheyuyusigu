The mug was merch from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a stunt gone viral</a> from a season 2 episode of Fielder’s Comedy Central series Nathan For You, which aired for four seasons on the network from 2013 to 2018.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>At the time, Musk wrote that his “coffee tastes unusually good this morning,” to which Fielder deadpanned in a quote-tweet: “Shoot me into space please.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shoot me into space please <a href=#>https://t.co/5PqRJs9UsN</a></p>— nathan fielder (@nathanfielder) <a href=#>February 18, 2016</a></figure><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Apparently, Musk is not to be threatened with a good time, so just weeks later Fielder gave an update on Instagram from a parking spot that had evidently been marked with his name at the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. It was widely assumed at the time that it was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a stunt being filmed</a> for the fourth season of Nathan For You, which had recently been renewed by Comedy Central.</p><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>“Bye,” Fielder simply captioned the image, though it’s unclear if Musk actually took him on a joyride.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nathan Fielder (@nathanfielder)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>At any rate, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Times profile</a> pulled back the curtain, ever so slightly, on the pair’s friendship, and it seems about as cringe and one-sided as one might expect from the guy who is currently musing on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">whether or not to buy Twitter for $44 million</a>.</p><p>“Mr. Musk has, in particular, pursued a friendship with one comedian whose public image revolves around the outrageous steps he takes to relate to other people: Nathan Fielder, who first became famous for his Comedy Central show Nathan For You, which turned a series of preposterous business ideas, including excrement-flavored frozen yogurt and athletic apparel dedicated to raising Holocaust awareness, into the definitive parody of modern American entrepreneurship.”</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>The piece goes on to note that Musk was a “huge fan” of Fielder’s, inviting him to lunch at SpaceX in 2016, adding: “For years afterward, the famous businessman invited the famous fake businessman to his parties and would strain to make the deadpan Canadian laugh.”</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>It’s unclear whether Musk and Fielder are still rubbing funny bones these days, or if their friendship, like countless others, fizzled out during the course of the pandemic. Or perhaps, even the enticement of a spaceship ride wasn’t enough to keep Fielder gritting his teeth through Musk’s jokes — unless he was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">just out of frame, laughing too</a>.</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>In either case, Fielder couldn’t have been less amused than he was at the Mets game over the weekend, anyway.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Best part of the game so far <a href=#>@nathanfielder</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2MAJjR2uro</a></p>— Brett Hanfling (@Brett_Hanfling) <a href=#>October 8, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=12 data-current-count=12 data-injectable=false>Poor Nathan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SyrbvNZqSuq5tis7O1xKebrKCZpXqvrdOhmKdllp6yrbDEq2SlmaWctW68wKurop2jZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bad-cupid-movie-review-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Bad Cupid movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2021)</span></a>
