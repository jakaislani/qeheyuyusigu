The Deadman dominated the early stages of this contest. They battled on the outside, and Undertaker's arm was cut open after Cena rammed him into the steel steps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cena managed to connect with the AA but the referee was knocked down.

John Cena and his former rival Brock Lesnar squared off with Kurt Angle and The Undertaker. Angle and Taker had Cena right where they wanted him as they wore him down.</p><p>The match was entertaining, and the pendulum swung in Cena and Lesnar's favor. Lesnar prevented Angle from victory as he applied the Angle Lock on Cena. The referee was distracted, and it allowed Cena to nail Angle in the skull with a chain, which resulted in Cena stealing the victory for his side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-man-royal-rumble-match---smackdown-1-29-04-7-54><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>15-Man Royal Rumble Match - SmackDown 1/29/04 (7.54)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/15-Man-Royal-Rumble-Match-SmackDown-January-29-2004-Cropped.jpg><p>Royal Rumble matches are typically reserved for the Royal Rumble event itself.

Cena drew blood but he retaliated by ramming Eddie's head into a window. Cena attempted the AA on a car but Eddie countered it. Nonetheless, Eddie's nephew Chavo intervened, and Latino Heat retained the US Title with a Frog Splash on the hud of a car.</p><h2 id=john-cena-vs-kurt-angle---no-way-out-2005-7-82><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>John Cena Vs.

Cena joined the fray as the 25th participant</a>, and he was desperate to book his spot in the main event of WrestleMania 21. Cena eliminated the likes of Viscera and Kane, and with a helping hand from Batista, they eliminated Edge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The ending was memorable and chaotic. Both Cena and Batista went over the top rope simultaneously. That was unplanned and a seething Vince McMahon walked down the aisle, and he tore his quadriceps in a hilarious moment to watch. The match was restarted, and the Animal emerged victorious to win the Rumble for the first time in his career.</p><h2 id=royal-rumble-match---royal-rumble-2004-8-77><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Royal Rumble Match - Royal Rumble 2004 (8.77)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Cena-Royal-Rumble-2004-Cropped.jpg><p>The<a href=#> 2004 Royal Rumble match</a> presented a huge opportunity for Cena to go far. He was the 28th entrant, but he failed to live up to the expectations with a poor Royal Rumble showing for his standards.</p><p>Surprisingly, Cena endured seven minutes, but he failed to eliminate someone which is poor for someone of Cena's caliber. He attempted to eliminate Big Show with a few other wrestlers, but Show powered his way past them. Ultimately, the World's Largest Athlete eliminated Cena with Cena falling awkwardly which caused a knee injury.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJuts6hpWablaOubq7ErKtmpZGpsKmx0mapmqigmr9usdGaZJyZl5q6osDCoWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jarvis-landry-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jarvis Landry Net Worth : House &amp;amp; Endorsement</span></a>
