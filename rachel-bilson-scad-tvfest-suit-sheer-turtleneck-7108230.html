The annual SCAD TVfest at the Savannah College of Art and Design is bringing major names to speak about their projects and reminisce on their favorite TV moments. For this year's event,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rachel Bilson</a> arrived wearing an oversized, slouchy suit with a sheer turtleneck.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bilson's super-sexy take on business casual brought together a creamy, boxy tailoring with a skin-tight sheer top that showed off a sleek black bra. She paired it with pointy black pumps and she wore the blazer perched on her shoulders as she walked the carpet. She kept her beauty look true to her roots, with sun-kissed skin and fresh, pink cheeks. Her hair was tousled and she had her signature ombré honey-caramel color on full display.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bilson recently spoke to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Cut</a>&nbsp;about reuniting with her&nbsp;The OC&nbsp;co-star Mischa Barton, who famously said that she felt lonely and unsupported during the filming of the hit Fox teen drama. Barton joined Bilson&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>on her podcast</a>&nbsp;and the two watched the episode of the show where (spoiler) Marissa Cooper dies. Bilson noted that she had&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>never been able to watch the scene</a>&nbsp;before.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was so good to see Mischa. We really went through something so special together. I have nothing but so much love for her. And for us to be able to watch her final moment together — ’cause I could never watch it; when the music would start, I just couldn’t do it — to be able to do that with her, I felt like,&nbsp;Okay, we can support each other in this.&nbsp;It was just a really special moment, and I’m so happy that we got to do that together," Bilson said. "I just would love to see her and catch up because you don’t go through things like that often — or ever — in life. I just want her to feel supported, and hopefully we can spend some more time together, because I just really love her."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570ZqaoZ2cYq%2BquNKopWark5axbsDVn5ysrF2owqrAjKyfnp2iYsG2vtOlnKedk6B6eH2PcWlsaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./garry-shandling-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Garry Shandling Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
