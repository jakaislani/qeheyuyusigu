While Lenz is largely keeping the details of her 10-year cult experience vague — due, according to the star, to legal complications — her recent revelations in an episode of the Drama Queens podcast are sparking widespread discussion. Lenz will almost certainly share more in the future, once those legal hurdles have been traversed, but for now, we know little other than what she revealed in the podcast.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Which broadly comes down to her decade-long stint as a cult member, and the 10-year recovery that followed. As fans await more details about the tantalizing story, they’re taking a look back at Lenz’ career, and making a return to the Hallmark movies she’s frequented in the years since One Tree Hill aired its final episode.</p><h2 id=h-bethany-joy-lenz-hallmark-history data-injectable=false>Bethany Joy Lenz’ Hallmark history</h2><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>Lenz shifted from an early career in television dramas like One Tree Hill and Felicity to a stint on Hallmark. Starting in 2014, just two years after OTH concluded, she was appearing in a string of romantic favorites filmed in Hallmark’s unmistakable style.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Christmas Secret (2014)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>Lenz’ first-ever Hallmark movie released a few years after One Tree Hill‘s finale aired, and helped the star transition from young heartthrob into more mature roles. The film places Lenz in the lead role as Christine, a single mom who, upon discovering a magical family heirloom, uses its granted good fortune to find Christmas love.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Royal Matchmaker (2018)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=706 data-injectable=true>Royal Matchmaker served as Lenz’ second stint into the world of Hallmark romances, following around four years after the first. In the 2018 release, Lenz plays matchmaker Kate Gleason, who is tapped to find love for Prince Sebastian of Voldavia. As she hunts for the right woman, Kate gradually discovers her own growing feelings for the charming prince and eventually falls head over heels in love.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Bottled With Love (2019)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>By 2019, Lenz was well and truly a Hallmark staple. She was starring in her third Hallmark film, Bottled With Love, alongside fellow TV favorite Andrew Walker. The film tells a story of unexpected love found in the unlikeliest of places, after lovelorn Abbey (played by Lenz) tosses an emotions-bared letter out to sea in a bottle, which is discovered several months later by a handsome fisherman.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>A Valentine’s Match (2020)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>Bottled With Love truly launched Lenz’ career over at Hallmark, if the following year is any example. 2020 saw Lenz appear in a full three Hallmark movies, the first of which was fittingly A Valentine’s Match. The holiday flick was released just in time to celebrate its titular holiday, and stars Lenz as ex-reality television host Natalie, who is tricked by her scheming mother into hosting her hometown auction with her ex-fiancé.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Just My Type (2020)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Just over a month later, Lenz’ next Hallmark movie — March’s Just My Type — was also landing on televisions everywhere. This time, Lenz plays Venessa, a writer hailing from New York City, who’s set on landing an interview with celebrated mystery author Martin Clayborne. What follows is classic Hallmark — and pure joy for fans of romance.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Five Star Christmas (2020)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=false>Lenz’ most recent Hallmark movie, and her second Christmas-themed release, came out at the tail end of everyone’s least favorite year. Five Star Christmas follows the Ralston family — of which Lenz is a member — as they work to trick a travel reviewer into giving their bed and breakfast a five-star rating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXZeytbTAp7Bmop%2Bueq2xzbNkoZmcobqivspmpKiumZrAbrXNZqarnJWnerCyjKucpZ2RqLJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./white-chocolate-cranberry-fudge.html><span>←</span><span>White Chocolate Cranberry Fudge - Mom On Timeout</span></a>
