Here’s her response:</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>“People like you disgust me. Trying to pray [sic] on the vulnerable. Well let me tell you something. I may look cute but I have a smart a** mouth and I’m not afraid to tell you to go f*ck yourself.”</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>Seiter then shared a message on his Instagram stories he merely reached out to Blanchard as a friend. “All I did was ask to get to know her … This was totally uncalled for,” he said.</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>In the past, Seiter had shared he found Blanchard “adorable” and that he had a “crush on her” (via <a href=#>In Touch Weekly</a>).</p><h2 id=h-blanchard-s-spoken-for data-injectable=false>Blanchard’s spoken for</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Untitled-design-34.png><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>It’s unclear if Josh Seiter realized that Gypsy Rose Blanchard married Ryan Anderson in 2022 before contacting her. Blanchard, however, reportedly wasted no time reminding him in one of her two replies to the reality TV star. (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Contrary to reports they split</a>, Blanchard told Seiter she and Anderson are still together.)</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>“I don’t know who you are, or why you chose ME to try and find your 15 minutes of fame, but I have friends everywhere and I know what lies you’ve told online. I am a married woman, my husband’s name is Ryan Anderson and we do NOT appreciate crazy people like you spreading lies,” Blanchard said.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Seiter apparently wouldn’t take no for an answer and kept re-adding himself to Blanchard’s Instagram, so Blanchard’s partner, Anderson, also sent Seiter DMs and threatening voicemails warning him to quit contacting her. Seiter denies he re-added Blanchard after she shot him down the first time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Has Josh Seiter moved on?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Untitled-design-33.png><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Whatever the truth is about Josh Seiter’s intentions with Blanchard — he told TV Shows Ace he was open to a “romantic connection” but also ready to offer his legal services (he has a law degree) — he seems undeterred in his search for love.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>In an Instagram story, Seiter said, “I am heartbroken that things didn’t work out between me and Gypsy but I will not give up on finding love” (via In Touch Weekly).</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Since appearing on The Bachelorette, Seiter’s been romantically linked to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">90 Day Fiancé‘s Karine Staehle and Yolanda Leak</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Love After Lockup‘s Lizzie Kommes and Glorietta Besos</a>. In July 2023, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch Weekly</a> reported that Seiter had been in an open relationship with a woman named Jennifer since 2019.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=false>On Dec. 28, 2023, Blanchard, aged 32 at the time, was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released from prison early</a> for the role she played in the 2015 murder of her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard, by Gypsy’s online boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn.
