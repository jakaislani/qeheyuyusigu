Jackson will return to the franchise as Mace Windu. After all, we never saw his body, and such a powerful Jedi Master should be able to theoretically survive being thrown out of a window. The counterpoint is that if Mace were alive, you’d have expected him to reappear in Star Wars by now, as the Rebel Alliance could have really used his talents during the original trilogy.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>The canon story is that Mace’s aggressive dueling technique flirted with the Dark Side, so perhaps he could have turned to evil while recovering from his Revenge of the Sith injuries. To be honest, we’d rather Star Wars stopped bringing back dead characters as the more they do it, the cheaper every other death becomes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqq2ZomLEor7SZp2apqNivrax0q2gqKZdnby4ecCnsKimlWKwsMHLnWShmaaaeqbCxKtkm52cnrK3scNmpqedXaSzbsDHnmSsnaGqsq1506ugpaeXrsBuuc6sq2aekad6p7HTnJ%2BenF2ptaa70aKcrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kei-nishikori.html><span>←</span><span>Kei Nishikori Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
