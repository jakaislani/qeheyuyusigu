<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Lincoln movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2012)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Lincoln believed slavery was immoral, but he also considered the 13th Amendment a masterstroke in cutting away the financial foundations of the Confederacy. In the film, the passage of the amendment is guided by William Seward (<a href=#>David Strathairn</a>), his secretary of state, and by Rep. Thaddeus Stevens (<a href=#>Tommy Lee Jones</a>), the most powerful abolitionist in the House. Neither these nor any other performances in the film depend on self-conscious histrionics; Jones in particular portrays a crafty codger with some secret hiding places in his heart.</p><p>The capital city of Washington is portrayed here as roughshod gathering of politicians on the make. The images by <a href=#>Janusz Kaminski</a>, Spielberg's frequent cinematographer, use earth tones and muted indoor lighting. The White House is less a temple of state than a gathering place for wheelers and dealers. This ambience reflects the descriptions in Gore Vidal's historical novel "Lincoln," although the political and personal details in Tony Kushner's concise, revealing dialogue is based on "Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln" by Doris Kearns Goodwin. The book is well-titled. This is a film not about an icon of history, but about a president who was scorned by some of his political opponents as just a hayseed from the backwoods.</p><p>Lincoln is not above political vote buying. He offers jobs, promotions, titles and pork barrel spending. He isn't even slightly reluctant to employ the low-handed tactics of his chief negotiators (Tim <a href=#>Blake Nelson</a>, <a href=#>James Spader</a>, <a href=#>John Hawkes</a>). That's how the game is played, and indeed we may be reminded of the arm-bending used to pass the civil rights legislation by Lyndon B. Johnson, the subject of another biography by Goodwin.</p><p>Daniel Day-Lewis, who has a lock on an Oscar nomination, modulates Lincoln. He is soft-spoken, a little hunched, exhausted after the years of war, concerned that no more troops die. He communicates through stories and parables. At his side is his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln (<a href=#>Sally Field</a>, typically sturdy and spunky), who is sometimes seen as a social climber but here is focused as wife and mother. She has already lost one son in the war and fears to lose the other. This boy, Robert Todd Lincoln (<a href=#>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a>), refuses the privileges of family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46loKebn6G7bn6Pamk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lauren-silverman.html><span>←</span><span>Lauren Silverman Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
