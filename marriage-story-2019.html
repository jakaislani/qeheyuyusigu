<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Marriage Story movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>And it’s easy to do that with these stunning performances. Driver and Johansson have both been remarkable before, but this is a new career watermark for both, repaying Baumbach’s trust in them with emotional and complex work.&nbsp;They’re good throughout, but they each get a “scene” on their own—a background speech from Nicole when she first goes to Nora and a breathtaking one from Charlie at a bar near the end—and a scene together, the big fight that we never think will happen with our partners. The one where we say what we shouldn’t say. The one where things change forever.</p><p>The two leads own the film, but Baumbach’s skill with ensemble has become remarkable over the years, and this is his best work. There are minor parts&nbsp;from great performers like <a href=#>Merritt Wever</a>, <a href=#>Wallace Shawn</a>, and <a href=#>Ray Liotta</a>, along with a memorable&nbsp;supporting turn by <a href=#>Alan Alda</a> as Charlie’s attorney, an old soul who has seen the pain divorce can cause (he’s had three of them). And then there’s Dern, who continues to stake her claim as one of the best working actresses. Even she gets a “scene”—this one about the gender inequality in the way women and men are portrayed in divorce—that tears the house down.</p><p>In 2005, Baumbach made a film that’s essentially about the divorce of his parents called “<a href=#>The Squid and the Whale</a>.” That was from a child’s perspective. Almost 15 years later, it feels like he’s matured to a point where he’s willing to see the issue from the other side. And whereas that film has some notable anger, this one feels much more compassionate and understanding of human fallibility—the product of a mature, masterful filmmaker. What comes through in every frame of this film is that Baumbach loves Nicole and Charlie. And we come to care about them a great deal too. When we say goodbye to this pair, we hope that they both find happiness, reaching for life after the death of divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>This review was filed from the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10th.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46mmKuqmZa0pnnSraarsV1nfXKF</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jill-marie-jones.html><span>←</span><span>Jill Marie Jones Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
