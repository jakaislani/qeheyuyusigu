You might not have Drake being a&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;fan on your 2022 Bingo card, but eagle-eyed fans have had him on the radar for quite some time.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0908E493-3DA6-4805-8AE4-64FF691CF511.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/88D6DB58-CB87-4160-ADBF-6ED32B34C9F2.jpeg><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>In early 2022, Drake was in Detroit and walked into an establishment where fans were excited to see him, especially one named Brittany. She asked if she could record their meeting, and he said yes, so she switched her camera to the right direction, and we saw Drake wearing Dutton merch. A pullover with the ranch’s logo, in fact, and he looked great in it.&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;fans know it’s all about the brand, so to see him rocking it shows his dedication to the series.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>The cast also noted Drake donning Y merch, and Jefferson White, who plays Jimmy, announced that if he’s ever in the area, shots of Tequila are on the house. Or rather, shots of Tequila are on Ian Bohen’s tab! He also invited Brittany to come along, too — she is the one who let us on to his&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;fan status, after all.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can’t believe Drake watches <a href=#>@Yellowstone</a> – both of you stop by the ranch, whiskey and tequila on <a href=#>@IanBohen</a> ‘s tab.</p>— Jefferson White (@_JeffersonWhite) <a href=#>June 3, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Fans are calling on Yellowstone to bring the Degrassi alum in for a cameo, and we have to say, we’re totally on board for this. They’re tiptoeing into more music territory, or he could come in as a character of his own: maybe a traveling cowboy who happens upon the ranch? Could he be someone who will work against the Duttons for some time? The possibilities are endless.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@Yellowstone</a> can y’all make a <a href=#>@Drake</a> cameo on <a href=#>#YellowstoneTV</a> happen already?! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XPm0mYP9BI</a></p>— ↳ 𝕜𝕠𝕝𝕒 𝕓𝕠𝕤𝕤𝕒 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕒 🫧 (@SoulGlitch94_) <a href=#>October 23, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>The gift has to be one of the most extraordinary ways to be honored on your big day.
