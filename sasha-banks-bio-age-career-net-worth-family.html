On October 1, 2010, she entered the ring for the first time as Mercedes KV. In an intergender tag team match against Alexxis and Danny E, she teamed up with Nikki Roxx. Banks and Roxx rapidly established a partnership, working together frequently and going to ringside together.</p><p>Banks won her first bout on January 7, 2011, when she and Roxx triumphed against Alexxis and Mistress Belmont in a tag team contest. On February 11, Banks attempted to become the first Chaotic Wrestling Women’s Champion by competing in a five-woman gauntlet match, but she was unsuccessful.</p><p>Barbie was the opponent for Banks’ first successful title defense on January 6, 2012. On January 27, Banks met Luscious Latasha with the championship on the line, and KV won. In a rematch, Banks triumphantly defended the title over Alexxis.</p><p>The championship was then twice successfully defended by her against Nikki Roxx. After retaining the title on June 1 against Alexxis, Barbie, and Mistress Belmont in a fatal four-way match, Banks broke Alexxis’s previous record of 182 days to become the longest-reigning Chaotic Wrestling Women’s Champion in history.</p><p>Banks made her professional wrestling debut in New England Championship Wrestling (NECW) on August 8 when she teamed up with Ivy to defeat Sammi Lane and Ariel’s team.</p><p>Banks attended a WWE tryout camp in June 2012, and on August 18 it was revealed that she had been offered a contract.

Following this, Banks entered a plot in which she began receiving letters from a mysterious admirer. It was later discovered that this person was Audrey Marie, who later returned to assault Banks on the NXT show airing on February 20 out of retaliation for Banks’ success.</p><p>The NXT Women’s Champion Paige defeated Banks after weeks of Summer Rae’s influence, and although Paige tried to console her, Banks assaulted her, turning her into a villain. This all happened on the September 11 episode of NXT.</p><p>Banks was defeated by Bayley in a contest to decide the top challenger for the NXT Women’s Championship on the August 14 episode of NXT. After Bayley’s title match with Charlotte at NXT TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way on September 11, Banks attacked her before Charlotte stopped her.</p><p>Banks lost the NXT Women’s Championship to Bayley at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn on August 22, ending her 192-day reign.</p><p>Following Stephanie McMahon’s demand for a “revolution” in the WWE Divas division, Banks made her formal debut on the July 13, 2015, episode of Raw with Charlotte and Becky Lynch.</p><p>During a month off the air, Banks made her television debut again on January 24, 2016, at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, when she attacked Charlotte and Becky Lynch following their championship bout to signal her desire to win the Divas Championship.</p><p>After a break, Banks returned to WWE television in early June, and after an attack alongside Paige on the June 20 episode of Raw, she later resumed her feud with Charlotte over the WWE Women’s Championship.</p><p>Banks, Bayley, and Mickie James began a feud with the newly-debuting faction Absolution (Paige, Mandy Rose, and Sonya Deville) at&nbsp;the close of 2017, as they were repeatedly attacked on several occasions. This resulted in numerous singles and tag team contests, most of which were won by Absolution.</p><p>Following weeks of tension between the two, including Bayley abandoning Banks during their matches, they got into a fight backstage and had to be removed on the March 26 episode of Raw.</p><p>The following day, Banks abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance on Wendy, a morning talk show. The following week, rumors from dirt sheets spread that she was considering leaving the company because of her long-standing grievances with WWE.</p><p>Following WrestleMania 36, Banks and Bayley teased the possibility of a rivalry, with the emphasis on the narrative that Banks is the cause of Bayley’s success and that Bayley is mostly to blame for Banks’ losing endeavors.</p><p>Banks and Asuka competed for the Raw Women’s Championship on July 19 at The Horror Show at Extreme Rules. The contest was marred by controversy after Asuka unintentionally spit green mist in the referee’s face. Once the referee’s shirt was gone, Bayley counted the pin to declare Banks the undisputed champion.</p><p>Banks suffered a calcaneus injury on January 2, 2022, while competing against Charlotte Flair in a house show match. On the SmackDown broadcast from January 28 she would return, where she declared for the Royal Rumble match.</p><p>Varnado, now known by the ring name Mercedes Moné, debuted for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) on January 4, 2023, at Wrestle Kingdom 17, when she faced Kairi, the IWGP Women’s Champion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sasha Banks parents</h2><p>Banks was born to Reo Varnado and Judith Varnado.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sasha Banks siblings</h2><p>Banks has a brother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sasha Banks husband</h2><p>Banks is married to Sarath Ton.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sasha Banks children</h2><p>Banks has no child at the time of filing this report.</p><p>Source; <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqyYrKCRYq%2BiusqsZJuhn2KuqLGMnJirnZWneq%2Bx02auqKqknXqnrcyio7Jn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roscoe-dash-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Roscoe Dash Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
