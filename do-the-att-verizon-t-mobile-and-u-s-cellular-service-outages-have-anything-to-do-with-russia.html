It probably did feel like that for a while, you never realize how dependent you are on your phone until you can’t use it anymore; in fact, maybe everything would go exactly the way it did in the movie. The internet, and other methods of communicating in the 21st century, are practically a lifeline for some people, so it would be a disaster if they went down. If someone wanted to cause panic, taking down cellular service would be the first step. That’s what people on X (formerly Twitter) have been saying, anyways.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>So, do y'all think this is China/Russia/etc testing our cellular network capabilities (or lack thereof) or just a "random coincidence" that all these networks are down simultaneously? <a href=#>#noservice</a> <a href=#>#outage</a> <a href=#>#outages</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/U4TSvvnez1</a></p>— 🕹MickJayPlays🕹️ (@MickJayPlays) <a href=#>February 22, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=40 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>Some think that Russia is testing nukes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wonder if the AT&T outage is the result of Russia testing their space nukes???

There’s no evidence yet to suggest Russia was responsible; <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">while CNN reports</a> that the White House federal agencies have been talking with AT&T to get to the bottom of the outages, the truth is nobody knows yet. We’re not ruling out the possibility that Russia was involved, but let’s wait until something’s confirmed before we start panicking and looting (not that anyone has started yet).</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>National Security spokesperson John Kirby reported that the FBI were looking into the issue to get answers. Whilst the FBI don’t usually get involved with service outages, it’s probably better to be safe than sorry, and do a thorough investigation. Again, this doesn’t mean anything yet.</p><h2 id=h-could-there-be-other-reasons data-injectable=false>Could there be other reasons?</h2><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=810 data-injectable=false>A network going down isn’t exactly breaking news, minor outages in certain areas happen all the time. Telecom companies maintain that they usually happen for mundane reasons, such as software misconfigurations, and sometimes even construction work damaging fiber optic cables. While there are still thousands without service, AT&T claims that around 75% has been restored so far. Hopefully the rest of the network is restored soon, and we don’t end up like Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke in that Netflix movie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeWrrZwsM5mq6GdXZbBtXnVnqmisp%2BjerV5zKiZoqSVYq6vsIyuZKxlk5q5rcHLmqlmq5Wnw6qvxGamrqyRnLK0ecearZ5lkaPGtbTIp55mrJ9isbB51qKroWWiqsC0tcBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./c-j-mosleys-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>C.J.
