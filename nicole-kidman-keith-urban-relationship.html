They’ve since welcomed two daughters — Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret — and never stop gushing about each other in interviews.

The two were introduced for the first time at the January 2005 G'Day USA gala, though their epic romance didn’t kick off right away. Instead, it took Urban months to finally call Kidman.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I wasn’t in a very healthy place in my life," Urban said in 2018 on the Australian talk show <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/keith-urban-tells-denton-that-nicole-kidman-s-intervention-was-love-in-action-20180731-p4zuqc.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Interview class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Interview</a>. "I'd never have thought she’d see anything in a guy like me. But at some point I plucked up the courage to call those numbers and she answered, and we started talking and we talked and talked and talked and talked and it was effortless."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Urban then whisked her off her feet (quite literally) on her birthday that year when he surprised her with a trip to Woodstock, New York on his motorcycle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It was my [38th] birthday, and he stood outside with gardenias at 5 a.m. on my stoop in New York,” Kidman told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/nicole-kidman-reveals-moment-keith-urban-love-my-life/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>. “That is when I went, ‘This is the man I hope I get to marry.'”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It was pretty intense,” Kidman added. “I believed by that point he was the love of my life. Maybe that’s because I am deeply romantic, or I’m an actress, or I have strong faith as well, but I just believed, ‘Oh, okay, here he is.'”</p><img alt="Nicole Kidman Keith Urban" title="Nicole Kidman Keith Urban" width=4928 height=3280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1159656854.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</span><p>Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban in 2019</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The pair faced huge struggles early on in their marriage</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">They didn’t wait long to walk down the aisle.

The singer had previously been to rehab twice before his October 2006 stay and had been open about having problems with addiction and drugs like cocaine. After Kidman staged an intervention following their wedding, the singer has been able to stay sober ever since.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I caused the implosion of my fresh marriage," Urban said in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/keith-urbans-hard-road-56138/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> interview in 2016. “It survived, but it’s a miracle it did. I was spiritually awoken with her. I use the expression ‘I was born into her,’ and that’s how I feel. And for the first time in my life, I could shake off the shackles of addiction.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2008, Urban and Kidman <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/parents/nicole-kidman-a-2/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="welcomed their first daughter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">welcomed their first daughter</a>, Sunday Rose.

Through it all, their support for each other has kept them going. In 2019, Kidman expressed how lucky she is to have Urban in her life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I have the most extraordinary partner in life.
