But the movie suffers from one inescapable misfortune: It arrives while ‚ÄúDead Man Walking‚Äù is still fresh in our memory. That film was an unquestioned masterpiece, containing some of the best writing, acting and directing of recent years. ‚ÄúLast Dance‚Äù can't stand up against it. Too many of its scenes are based on conventional ideas of story construction. We can see the bones beneath the skin.

The visionary character created and drawn by the talented Mike Mignola doesn‚Äôt conform easily ‚Äì in the comics or on the big screen. Just as he sounds, Hellboy is a contradiction.

‚ÄúKillers of the Flower Moon‚Äù may not be a traditional gangster picture, but it's completely in tune with the stories of corrupt, violent men that Scorsese has explored for a half-century. And yet there‚Äôs also a sense of age in Scorsese‚Äôs work here, the feeling that he's using&nbsp;this horrifying true story to interrogate how we got to where we are&nbsp;a hundred years later.
