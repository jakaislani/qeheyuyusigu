The day after killing his mother, he loaded a car up with three guns, 12 Molotov cocktails, and ammunition and began driving to Trudeau’s home.</p><p>He dropped that plan after a few hours and considered shooting up Simon Fraser University, where he was a student — but ultimately drove to a police station and turned himself in for his mother’s murder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3Jma3FfmsVuvsivnKuckaGybq3CraarZaKurq95xquYp6yYlrpussSaqaxllqS%2Fbr%2FAn5ytsV2eu2680aKqqKZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./damien-harriss-wiki-family-siblings-religion-ethnicity.html><span>←</span><span>Damien Harriss Wiki | Family, Siblings, Religion, Ethnicity</span></a>
