According to Huy Fong Inc., the company behind the ubiquitous rooster-brand sriracha hot sauce, the shortage is being caused by a heat wave-induced drought that has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">affected their chili pepper crops</a>. Sriracha prices may be on the rise and, before long, it could even become impossible to get your hands on this famously delicious, garlicky hot sauce.</p><p>Don’t panic, though! There are a few alternatives to Huy Fong sriracha that should get the job done in your time of need. I’ve compiled some of the best, and you may want to bookmark this article just in case the shortage does get dire. We don’t want you to have to turn to the inevitable sriracha black market to get your fix.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

I’d describe it as classic sriracha but with a little extra oomph. Plus, Weak Knees Gochujang Sriracha is even more ideal for Korean food since gochujang is a Korean ingredient! I also like to squirt this onto a boiled egg for the perfect tasty bite. On June 14, Bushwick Kitchen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">assured customers</a> that their sriracha sauces were still available, “with no foreseeable shortage expected.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fix-green-sriracha-hot-sauce><strong>Fix Green Sriracha Hot Sauce</strong></h2><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy from Amazon</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SRIRACHA-SHORTAGE-REPLACEMENTS_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_02.jpg><p><br>I kid you not: My mouth is salivating thinking about this sauce. It has a powerful lemongrass flavor that compliments dishes from all over Asia. The burn lingers in your mouth. Fix’s Green Sriracha and noodles are a match made in heaven.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mother-in-law-s-garlic-gochujang-fermented-chile-sauce><strong>Mother In Law’s Garlic Gochujang Fermented Chile Sauce</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SRIRACHA-SHORTAGE-REPLACEMENTS_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_03.jpg><p>I could drink the juice from a jar of Mother In Law’s kimchi, so it’s no surprise that their hot sauce is great. While they don’t label this as sriracha, I think it would make for a great replacement. It’s a little thick and super garlicky, so it hits all those sriracha-y notes we know and love.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-yellowbird-blue-agave-sriracha><strong>Yellowbird Blue Agave Sriracha</strong></h2><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy from Amazon</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SRIRACHA-SHORTAGE-REPLACEMENTS_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_04.jpg><p>I think this sriracha tastes the most similar to the Huy Fong brand. It’s maybe a smidge sweeter, but, to be honest, it’s possible that the promise of “blue agave” on the label just makes me think it’s sweeter. Either way, it tastes delicious! The spice is well-rounded and fills your mouth. This is hardly a shock though, since Yellowbird literally never misses.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kitchen-garden-farm-organic-ghost-pepper-sriracha-super-hot-chili-sauce><strong>Kitchen Garden Farm Organic Ghost Pepper Sriracha Super Hot Chili Sauce</strong></h2><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy from Amazon</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SRIRACHA-SHORTAGE-REPLACEMENTS_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_05.jpg><p>If you’re on the hunt for something with the flavor of sriracha but a much higher heat level, Kitchen Garden Farm’s Organic Ghost Pepper Sriracha will knock your socks off. Like anything containing the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">notoriously spicy ghost pepper</a>, this isn’t for the faint of heart (or weak of mouth), but it’s sure to satisfy any heat-lover.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKuYnr%2Bir8eaZKygn6fBorPEZpilrJWnu6LAyK%2BcrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./red-velvet-white-chocolate-cookies.html><span>←</span><span>Red Velvet White Chocolate Cookies</span></a>
