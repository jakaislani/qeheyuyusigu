THEIR. AGE. ‘You can’t fall in love with someone else until you fall in love with yourself,’ as the phrase goes.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Joshua-Teasley-2.jpg alt="Joshua Teasley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It goes on:</p><p>“These three ladies will be able to do both at the Groove Hotel! Whether they discover the ideal fling, friendship, real love, or whatever in between, this is their time to take responsibility and overcome the double standards that older women confront on a daily basis. And they’re going to have a great time doing it! Taye Diggs hosts the program, and he knows a thing or two about getting into the groove.”</p><p>Joshua “Josh” Teasley is one of the single males that will appear on Back in the Groove.
