It’s all about her now. It’s all about what she’s here to accomplish and do and I’m just here to support her in that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/s.jpeg><p>Brandy is now promoting her new Chance The Rapper-assisted single “Baby Mama,” a cut from her forthcoming album; it’s her first since “Two Eleven,” released eight years ago.</p><p>The song is an ode to being a single mother and motherhood in general. Its colorful <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>video</a> was released on Monday, May 4, and it shows Brandy dancing in a warehouse, while Chance shows up to deliver the sing-songy rap style that’s made him famous.</p><p>Brandy <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>shared</a> a few details about “Baby Mama” with Rolling Stone when the video was released, including about the song’s concept.</p><p>“I feel so honored to be a mom and taking care of my baby,” she said. “It’s a dedication to her and to all moms who are doing the same thing.”</p><p>Smith’s father is Robert “Big Bert” Smith, a music producer. He and Brandy split in 2002, shortly after their daughter’s birth. “Moesha,” the sitcom that aired on UPN, ran from 1996 to 2001.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9xe49uZmltX5e%2ForrDsmSesKChrqq60mauobFdqLWmecOonKympGLEosDCoWSmp5WotaJ51qKroWWYmr9uwMSepZqflWKxosHGoaueql8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bas-hamad.html><span>←</span><span>Bas Hamad</span></a>
