Gypsy Rose Blanchard, convicted of helping to kill her mother and sentenced to 10 years in prison, had a most unexpected person slide into her DMs while behind bars: The Bachelorette‘s Josh Seiter. According to Seiter, however, any flirty overtones in his message were unintentional — you be the judge.

Metro: Last Light As always, kicking off our look at performance is 4A Games’ latest entry in their Metro series of subterranean shooters, Metro: Last Light.

Warning: the following article contains spoilers for ‘The Last of Us’ episode two
Recommended Videos It would seem that HBO’s The Last of Us is hell-bent on sneaking in a cameo of all the big names involved with both the creation of the original video game and the TV series.
