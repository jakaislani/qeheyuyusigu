<a href=../../../../best-honey-ham.html></a>
Let’s talk honey ham. It’s so good, it inspired a whole chain of stores. I speak, of course, of The Honey Baked Ham Co., which sells, almost entirely, honey baked ham. That crackling, sticky-sweet rind. That juicy, savory meat. My family used to get one every New Year’s Day for a party (leave the NYE party to the amateurs, the real pros party in the daylight). And the best part was the sandwich after the party made with leftover honey ham slices.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Indian Matchmaking Aparna Shewakramani: Wiki, Biography, Age, Husband, Instagram</h2><time>Sep 6, 2024</time>

I can hardly believe that Cinco de Mayo is coming up in less than TWO weeks! Cinco de Mayo is my unofficial kick-off to summer. Here in Sacramento, it’s already warm if not HOT. By mid-May we’ll have hit 100. It’s inevitable.

<a href=../../../../10-movies-that-surprisingly-pass-the-bechdel-test.html></a>
The Bechdel test is the most popular tool for assessing female representation in film. To pass, a movie must have two named women converse about something other than a man. It sounds simple, but nearly half of surveyed films fail. With female faves like The Lion King, Finding Nemo, and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire failing the test, it’s easy to assume that virtually all “guy movies” are Bechdel bombs.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Gods of Egypt movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)</h2><time>Sep 5, 2024</time>

It's stocked mainly with super-fit actors, few of whom are likely in the ballpark of what actual ancient Egyptians looked like, unless Egypt was populated mainly by white folks with gym-sculpted bods. Proyas sort-of-apologized last year for the casting, saying he would've hired more actors of color if it hadn't made the movie so hard to finance at the budget level he needed. As is, the most prominent nonwhite actor is Chadwick Boseman as a faintly bitchy incarnation of Thoth, the father of science, religion, philosophy and magic.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jack Lemmon Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Sep 5, 2024</time>

I got back home Sunday after an exciting couple days at the BYB Conference in Salt Lake City. I arrived on Friday and within a few hours I had almost completely lost my voice. Not the first thing you want to happen at a conference by any means, but I managed to struggle through the weekend without too much talking.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/5/>← Prev Page</a>
