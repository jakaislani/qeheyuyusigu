And I almost overlooked the subplot involving the nosy TV anchorwoman, and the other one involving the electronics tycoons.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Emmanuel Hostin | Father Dr. A.

Bringing Gaming to the Masses
Where I honestly believe Llano shines is in its ability to bring a usable CPU and solid if unspectacular gaming performance south of the $600 price point. Similar configurations to this 17" Toshiba Satellite L775D-S7206 can be had for around $549 or less if you don't mind going down to a smaller, more portable form factor; Toshiba even offers a 14" notebook with the same APU and 4GB of RAM for just that price.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Legendary Actress &amp;amp; Singer, Doris Day Dies At The Age of 97</h2><time>Jun 19, 2024</time>
