I seen a girl on a one way corridor
stealing down a wrong way street
for all the world like an urban toreador
she had wheels on on her feet
well the cars do the usual dances
same old cruise and the kerbside crawl
but the rollergirl she’s taking chances
they just love to see her take them all
no fears alone at night she’s sailing through the crowd
in her ears the phones are tight and the music’s playing loud</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Eva Jacqueline Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

Yet there is no mistaking when Loach employs it, no matter the decade, the setting, the actors or who's manning the camera (in this case, Robbie Ryan, the lensman of Andrea Arnold's kinetic "Fish Tank" and "Wuthering Heights"). Loach's realism always carries a distinct sense of humor, volatility and, most alarmingly in this hypercapitalist new century, a socialist passion for The People.
