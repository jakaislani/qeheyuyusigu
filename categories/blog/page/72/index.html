<a href=../../../../fellinis-outrageous-roma-restored-on-criterion-blu-ray.html></a>
The frustrating thing about "Roma" is that one can see Fellini testing out ideas he'd use to lesser effect in later films. The first part, which takes up about 40 minutes, is set in Rome during World War II. It features a reporter (Peter Gonzales) who seems to be a Fellini stand-in. Here is the genesis of his overtly autobiographical "Amarcord" (1973). But this section of "Roma" makes magic by swirling Fellini's genuine memories of Fascist Italy with a hallucinatory shifting of place.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Wes Anderson Collection, Chapter 4: &amp;quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&amp;quot; | MZS</h2><time>Apr 29, 2024</time>

I love how Roger Ebert's review of "The Life Aquatic"&nbsp;quotes a cutting phrase from his TV review of the film, but in service of what already feels like a revision: "My rational mind informs me that this movie doesn't work. Yet I hear a subversive whisper: Since it does so many other things, does it have to work, too? Can't it just&nbsp;exist?&nbsp;'Terminal whimsy,' I called it on the TV show. Yes, but isn't that better than half-hearted whimsy, or no whimsy at all?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>13 Best Popsicles, According to Our Taste Tests</h2><time>Apr 28, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../best-popsicles.html></a>
We‚Äôre no poets, but the best popsicles should taste like the first days of summer vacation and endless sunshine. They should be refreshing, invigorating, and bursting with nostalgic flavors. The mere thought of the best popsicle should have you itching to hop on a bike and ride to your nearest convenience store just to pick an ice pop out of the cooler.&nbsp;
In case you missed our time-stamped, day-in-the-life of a Sporked taste-tester video, people have a lot of opinions about the correct way to open popsicles.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to read all the Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes books in order</h2><time>Apr 28, 2024</time>

Laurie R. King first introduced Mary Russell in 1994, and since then, the near-sighted genius has provided us with plenty of great tales. In the books, her mentor (and eventual husband) Sherlock Holmes helps her to solve mysteries, and despite many referring to these novels as the Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes books, she is definitely the star of the show.

By Nathan Kamal | Published 1 year ago Jennifer Lawrence seems to believe that her role as Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games franchise was the first time an action film had a female lead. In a conversation between Lawrence and fellow Academy Award winner Viola Davis featured in Variety, the X-Men actress stated that ‚Äúnobody had ever put a woman in the lead of an action movie.‚Äù While few could deny that Jennifer Lawrence‚Äôs performance as Katniss was one of the defining YA action film roles of the 2010s, it is also pretty factually inaccurate to describe her as the first female action movie lead.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Josh Sobo Net Worth</h2><time>Apr 28, 2024</time>

In and Around the MSI GX60
I'll say this for MSI: they've kept a pretty uniform aesthetic for their gaming notebooks. I'm actually of the opinion that the slightly smaller 15.6" form factor serves it better than the outsized 17.3", and the cooling system designs between the GX60 and its larger cousin are basically uniform. In fact, almost everything between the two chassis is uniform, making any kind of detailed analysis almost redundant.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is He Married Rachael Edith Emeryle?</h2><time>Apr 27, 2024</time>

Is that available on a streaming service?
It isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs available on DVD, but we‚Äôre looking into seeing if we can get it streamed and get some focus on it because it‚Äôs a very important film, I think. It‚Äôs one that I‚Äôve very proud of and has had a tremendous impact, actually, within its own world.&nbsp;
