When&nbsp;Allyson became pregnant just eight days into rehearsals, the studio instead brought in Judy Garland. This was immediately controversial both for the actress and the director, Charles Walters. Walters had a difficult shoot with Garland on their last film together, "Summer Stock," and Garland was promised an eight-month vacation by MGM. With her vacation cut short and Walters drawing the line at working with Garland again, producer Arthur Freed decided to replace the director with Stanley Donen.</p><p>Production trouble didn't stop there. Garland struggled in rehearsals even after a special song was written just for her. Behind the scenes, she was exhausted and stressed after a marathon run with MGM as a star for 14 years — appearing in 27 of the studio's films since she was a teenager. When she called out from rehearsals in June 1950, MGM fired her from "Royal Wedding." They released her from her contract just a few months later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDl2tscG5frLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjrZSueqit0aWYp5yjYr%2BwuMRmoKdloqTGoriMsJydnJmjtHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-hallick-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Hallick Net Worth</span></a>
