Since she was first introduced on the CBS soap opera way back in 1994, Phyllis Summers has been at the heart of some incredibly dramatic storylines that have involved everything from secretive affairs, dramatic divorces and the odd murder thrown in for good measure."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Can’t wait until she gets caught. It’s time,” commented one fan on Instagram.</p><p>While this fan added: “Phyllis is sooooo not dead…this is part of her and Stark’s plan”</p><p>This fan was on ‘Team Diane’ but still believes Phyllis’s death isn’t to be believed: “Team Diane on this. Phyllis is too obsessed with Diane. Love Phyllis too but she needs a new hobby and a new man. Faking her death just to get back at Diane is only going to backfire on her.”</p><p>“Yeah, she ain’t really dead,” commented this viewer. “She had this planned with him [Jeremy] to catch Diane in some type of trap and make it look like she killed her.”</p><p>And finally, this fan said what many were thinking: “Don’t worry the dead on soaps never die.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-4141-1024x518.png><p>The Young And The Restless <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">airs on weekdays</a> at 12:30pm ET on CBS.</p><h3 class=tags-title>Related Topics</h3><p><h2>MORE TV STORIES</h2><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXTnGWcp51ksq95xptma2hiaHxxgI5pa2ivmJbBbrTAqaeeppWZerW7jKmfsqScnsBuu81msKitnpx6orrDZquhnV2nsrTAy56qrGWWlru0ecCrnKesXZi8r8LIp5qenF2otaZ5w6KcnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harold-owen-wilmot-net-worth-income-html.html><span>←</span><span>Harold Owen Wilmot Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
