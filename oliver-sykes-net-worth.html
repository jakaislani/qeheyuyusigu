While still in school, Sykes became more interested in music, and even worked on a compilation CD under the name of Quakebeat. Besides that, he formed a mock hip hop band called Womb 2 Da Tomb alongside his brother and Matt Nicholls. Later on, he would join forces with Nicholls and form the band Bring Me The Horizon. However, he had yet another band, Purple Curto in which he was known as Olisaurus, and Sykes used that nickname in his subsequent solo career.</p><p>As of 2004, he joined the band called Bring Me The Horizon, which rose to fame over a short period of time; as of 2006, the band released their debut album, ‘‘Count Your Blessings’’, consisting of 10 songs such as ‘‘Pray for Plagues’’, ‘‘For Stevie Wonder’s Eyes Only (Braille)’’ and ‘‘A Lot Like Vegas’’. The album was first released in the UK, and in the following year it was available to the US audience; it received a mixed to negative response from the critics and audience, then in 2008, the band released another album, ‘‘Suicide Season’’, with the same result. In 2010, the band released their third album ‘‘Here Is a Hell, Believe Me, I’ve Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let’s Keep It a Secret.’’, which consisted of 12 tracks such as ‘‘Crucify Me’’, ‘‘Anthem’’ and ‘‘It Never Ends’’, and got more positive feedback, and did fairly well on charts peaking at number one on the UK Rock & Metal and UK Indie Albums Charts. Continuing to work at a rapid pace, Bring Me The Horizon released their fourth album, ‘‘Sempiternal’’, which consisted of 11 songs including ‘‘Can You Feel My Heart’’, ‘‘House of Wolves’’ and ‘‘Go To Hell, For Heaven’s Sake’’; it won the award for the Best Album, given by Alternative Press Awards in 2014. In the following year, Bring Me The Horizon released yet another album, entitled ‘‘That’s the Spirit’’, which got a mostly positive response and the 11 songs included ‘‘Doomed’’, ‘‘Happy Song’’ and ‘‘True Friends’’.</p><p>In addition to being a musician, Oliver is also a clothes designer and owns the brand Drop Dead Clothing.
