The show often invites guests to join their program, and that’s likely all Hilarious was ever intended to be. She appeared on the show several times over the course of 2023, but every time as a guest host. She’ll might return eventually — despite her seemingly negative view of the show — but she’ll probably never be a permanent fixture.</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>Much of the confusion about Hilarious’ permanence on the program was likely sparked by the radio show’s hunt through 2023 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for a new permanent host</a>. Hilarious was tapped on several occasions, and the permanent hosts, along with the fanbase, all seemed to be in full support of her. Her comments in early 2024 will likely disqualify her from a return, however, after she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slammed both Charlamagne Tha God</a> and DJ Envy as “trash” in an Instagram story.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where is Jess Hilarious now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>Hilarious might not have a future on The Breakfast Club, but that doesn’t mean she’s without prospects. She’s headed on tour in 2024, bringing her comedic talent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to a range of U.S. states</a> through March of this year. Assuming those appearances go well, its likely we’ll see Hilarious expand that tour to include several other states as well.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>And, given the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">high opinions Charlamagne Tha God</a> and DJ Envy have — or used to have — of Hilarious, you never know. Maybe they’ll invite her back on the show to discuss that Instagram story, among other things, and give her the chance to explain her sudden change in tone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZqKVqMButMilmKuhn6rAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./welcome-to-leith-2015.html><span>←</span><span>Welcome to Leith movie review (2015)</span></a>
