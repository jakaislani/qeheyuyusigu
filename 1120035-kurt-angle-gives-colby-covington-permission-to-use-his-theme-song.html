Covington is set to face off against former Welterweight Champion Robbie Lawler in the main event of UFC on ESPN 5, which will take place in Newark, New Jersey.</p><p>As you can see by the tweet, Bobby Lashley, who has worked extensively with Colby through American Top Team, helped to arrange the deal. MMA fans will be well aware of the fact that Covington is one of the biggest ‘characters’ in the sport, with some of his critics suggesting that he is trying to get some heel heat in order to try and gain a title shot against Kamaru Usman. Whether or not that pays off remains to be seen, but fans certainly can’t say that Colby isn’t trying to get his name out there.</p><p>“He [Colby Covington] has reached out, through a friend, to Kurt Angle, the former WWE Champion, who’s theme song was very popular while he was an active wrestler. It was popular because fans loved to chant ‘You suck!’ in the middle of the theme song. So the song would go something like ‘dun da da dun dun, you suck, you suck’ – the fans just couldn’t help themselves. He has asked Kurt if he can use that song because he wants people to chant ‘You suck!’ as he makes his way to the cage. So that’s a guy who clearly is very comfortable being booed.”</p><p>Please credit WrestleZone if you use the above transcription from ESPN’s The MMA Reporters</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>From today’s The MMA Reporters:<a href=#>@ColbyCovMMA</a> has gotten permission from <a href=#>@RealKurtAngle</a> to use Angle’s theme music for his entrance on Saturday. Covington’s friend <a href=#>@fightbobby</a> brokered the deal. Colby inviting the “you suck” chants before the fight.</p><p>Full: <a href=#>https://t.co/Yo6jLKxlS2</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rt1l5S0e5y</a></p><p>— Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) <a href=#>July 31, 2019</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBrZ2lrZWK4tr7TZpinn5yaeqi11Z6qZpufoa%2B6ecKoraKml6m8r3nPnqmmoaOotrC6jK2mZq2jmnqptdJmq6GdnZp6tLvNoA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ethan-torchio-age-sister-gender-short-hair-teeth-family-birthday-smile.html><span>←</span><span>Ethan Torchio Age, Sister, Gender, Short Hair, Teeth, Family, Birthday, Smile</span></a>
