I want to convey my thanks to all of you for your support, but also to those of you that have shared with me your personal relationships and experiences with my mom; you all have shown me a part of her life that I had only glimpsed over the years.</p><p>Despite what I could only describe as her being “difficult” at times, she was the best mother. She was also a doting grandmother, and her three grandchildren, who brought immense joy to her life, will miss her dearly.</p><p>She fought a courageous battle against a challenging medical condition, and even in her struggle, she continued to inspire us with her strength and resilience. At one point, a doctor expressed to me her surprise that she had stayed with us for this long, given her condition; I said, “If you knew my Mom, you wouldn’t be surprised.”</p><p>Your support throughout this journey has meant more than words can express. Your contributions, your messages of encouragement, and your presence in her life have made a difference and we are profoundly grateful for your kindness and generosity.</p><p>Thank you for being a part of my mother’s journey and for standing by us in both times of hope and moments of sorrow.
